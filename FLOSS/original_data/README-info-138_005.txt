NCAR/EOL 5 minute Quality Controlled ISFF data
https://data.eol.ucar.edu/dataset/138.005

Summary
This dataset contains 5 minute averaged NCAR/EOL Integrated Surface Flux
Facility (ISFF) data collected during the second phase of the Fluxes Over Snow
Surfaces (FLOSS-II) project that took place near Walden, CO in 2002-03. These
data are in NetCDF format, have been quality controlled, and winds from sonic
anemometers have not been tilt corrected and remain in a corrdinate system
relative to the sensor.
